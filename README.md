# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
A daily event planner that showcases the use of a third-party API (DayJS) to display and utilize data for the current day. This project demonstrates and builds upon the Bootstrap CSS framework, using various utilities from the framework such as buttons and modals. This project also uses jQuery as its foundation for interaction, the script largely using jQuery syntax to build a fully functional and showcases some concepts learned during the week such as jQuery click events and DOM traversal.

## Usage
The planner can be viewed [here](https://brian-lascuna.github.io/calendar-planner/).

At first glance, the user will be presented with the current date and color coded time blocks depending on whether or not the corresponding hour has passed or is yet to pass. The user can input text as they please into any time block and save it using the button to the right of the time block. Clicking the save button will save the text to the planner and will persist until it is cleared or changed. A "Clear Event Planner" button is available at the top of the page should the user wish to clear the entire planner.
